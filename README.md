# Shell Script Bug: Missing File Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting:  failure to handle the case where an input file is missing.  The `bug.sh` script attempts to process a file, but it lacks robust error handling. The `bugSolution.sh` script provides a corrected version with improved error handling.
